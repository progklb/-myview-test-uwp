# MyView Test: UWP

This is a test project for the MyView tvOS app. It is a very rough implementaton of a UWP app that plays a slideshow using images pulled via the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers) API. This was for experimental purposes only.

Sample JSON responses from the Unsplash API are included in the `Samples` folder.
