# MyView Test: UWP

This is a test project for the MyView tvOS app. It is a very rough implementaton of a UWP app that plays a slideshow using images pulled via the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers) API. This was for experimental purposes only.

The `Samples` folder contains the following:

- `*.jsonc` files: Sample JSON responses from the Unsplash API
- `xamarin-unsplash-downloader.rar`: A basic .NET console app made in Xamarin which tests retrieving of Unsplash images. The download logic in this app was ported to the UWP projetct.
